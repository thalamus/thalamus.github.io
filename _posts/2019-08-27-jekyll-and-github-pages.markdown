This is a WIP as I'm still learning how [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) works, but so far I'm pretty impressed with it.

I've taken the default minima theme, which is a very nice minimalistic theme, and given it a dark mode to make it less harsh on the eyes.

The reason for doing this is because none of the other dark themes that I could find were particularly current, or particularly good.

It works well on mobile devices, tablet devices and everything else.

And it's published on Github pages, which supports Jekyll in the back end and allows you to publish to your blog via git, which is very useful.

Hopefully I'll start posting some useful stuff on here soon...
